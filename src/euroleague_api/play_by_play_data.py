        Get the play-by-play (PBP) data enriched with the teams' lineups for
        every action in the PBP data.

        There are three cases where the player in the corresponding row
        (action) is not part of the lineup:

            1. When the player is subbed "OUT", the assigned lineup does not
            contain player name. Since this is reasonable, the value of the
            `validate_on_court_player` indicator is set to `True`.

            2. A player passes on to a teamate, who draws a shooting foul. If
            the passer is subbed before the first free throw and the first free
            throw is made then the subbed player is given an assist. However,
            the player is not in the extracted lineup because he has already
            been subbed. The value of the `validate_on_court_player`
            indicator is set to `False`. We don't fix the lineup, because it
            breaks the lineup continuinity. It is a quirk of the data
            collection andrecording.

            3. There are a few instances where a sub is recorded many seconds
            and actions since it actually happened. This causes issues, such
            as a player records an actions, such as a rebound, but he comes
            on the court (according to the data) many seconds after. This has
            been validated by watching theactual footage of the game. This
            requires a lot of manual work, which is beyond the score of this
            library. It is another quirk of the datacollection and recording,
            hence the value of the `validate_on_court_player` indicator is set
            to `False`.

                dataframe with two extra columns, which validate the validity
                and consistency of the extracted lineup. Defaults to True.
