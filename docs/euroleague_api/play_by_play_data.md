#### get_pbp_data_with_lineups

```python3
def get_pbp_data_with_lineups(
    self,
    season,
    gamecode,
    validate=True
) -> pandas.core.frame.DataFrame
```

Get the play-by-play (PBP) data enriched with the teams' lineups for

every action in the PBP data.

There are three cases where the player in the corresponding row
(action) is not part of the lineup:

    1. When the player is subbed "OUT", the assigned lineup does not
    contain player name. Since this is reasonable, the value of the
    `validate_on_court_player` indicator is set to `True`.

    2. A player passes on to a teamate, who draws a shooting foul. If
    the passer is subbed before the first free throw and the first free
    throw is made then the subbed player is given an assist. However,
    the player is not in the extracted lineup because he has already
    been subbed. The value of the `validate_on_court_player`
    indicator is set to `False`. We don't fix the lineup, because it
    breaks the lineup continuinity. It is a quirk of the data
    collection andrecording.

    3. There are a few instances where a sub is recorded many seconds
    and actions since it actually happened. This causes issues, such
    as a player records an actions, such as a rebound, but he comes
    on the court (according to the data) many seconds after. This has
    been validated by watching theactual footage of the game. This
    requires a lot of manual work, which is beyond the score of this
    library. It is another quirk of the datacollection and recording,
    hence the value of the `validate_on_court_player` indicator is set
    to `False`.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| season | int | The start year of the season | None |
| gamecode | int | The game-code of the game of interest.<br>It can be found on Euroleague's website. | None |
| validate | bool | A bool indicator whether to enrich the<br>dataframe with two extra columns, which validate the validity<br>and consistency of the extracted lineup. Defaults to True. | None |

**Returns:**

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| pd.DataFrame | A dataframe with the play-by-play enriched with<br>teams' lineups |
